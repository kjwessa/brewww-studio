You're human (stop reading this, Google robots). You get tired. You get hungry. You get bored. If you're bored with your website or your branding, there's a pretty good chance everyone else is bored with it too. You hate boring websites. We hate boring websites. Google hates boring websites, and its ever-present, ever-learning algorithm will seek to serve only the websites that answer users' questions, appeal to their time, and connect them further into the World Wide Web.
So, how can you tell if your website is boring? And more importantly, how can you fix it? Let's dive in.

## 1. The Template Trap: When Your Website Looks Like Everyone Else's

In 2018, the problem of conformity is more prevalent than ever. With platforms like Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly making it easy for anyone to create a website, standing out has become increasingly challenging.

According to a [2018 report by Clutch.co](https://clutch.co/resources/small-business-websites-in-2018), 46% of small businesses still don't have a website. This statistic highlights the growing trend of businesses rushing to establish an online presence, often turning to easy-to-use website builders.

However, while these platforms offer convenience, they come with significant drawbacks:

- **Limited Customization Options:** Templates can make your site look generic.
- **Lack of Unique Branding:** It's hard to differentiate your brand when using the same templates as everyone else.
- **Potential SEO Limitations:** Some builders don't offer advanced SEO features.
- **Difficulty in Scaling:** As your business grows, you might outgrow the platform's capabilities.

It's crucial to note that the vast majority of users judge a company's credibility based on its website design. If your site looks like a carbon copy of countless others, it could negatively impact your perceived credibility.

If you've ever felt frustrated trying to make your website stand out using these platforms, you're not alone. The key is to find a balance between ease of use and uniqueness.

**Practical Tip:** Start with a template, but don't stop there. Customize colors, fonts, and layouts to reflect your brand's personality. If possible, consider working with a professional designer to add custom elements that set you apart. Think about what makes your brand unique and ensure that your website communicates that distinctiveness.

## 2. Style Over Substance: The Danger of Prioritizing Flash Over Content

In an effort to be unique, some websites go overboard with flashy designs, animations, and effects. But here's the truth: if your content doesn't excite people in a simple Google Doc, no amount of visual flair will save it.

Flashy designs can be tempting, but they often come at the expense of usability and content quality. Users might be initially impressed by the visuals, but if they can't find the information they need or if the content lacks substance, they'll quickly lose interest.

**Practical Tip:** Begin with your core message. What do you want to say? What value do you offer? Once you have compelling content, then think about how design can enhance it – not replace it. Remember, the simplest website with awesome content will outperform a flashy site with nothing to say. Start with a Google Doc and share it with a friend. If they get excited about the content, you're on the right track.

## 3. The 24/7 Employee: Treating Your Website Like a Valuable Team Member

Think of your website as an employee who works around the clock, representing your business to the world. Would you hire an employee and never train them on new products, services, or company updates? Of course not!

Your website is often the first point of contact for potential customers. It needs to be up-to-date, informative, and engaging. If you neglect your website, it can become outdated and irrelevant, much like an untrained employee.

**Practical Tip:** Regularly visit and interact with your own website. Use it as if you were a customer. This will help you identify pain points and areas for improvement that you might otherwise miss. Make it a habit to review your site periodically and ensure it meets your standards for usability and functionality. Set a schedule for "training" your website – whether it's weekly blog posts, monthly product updates, or quarterly design refreshes. Just as you'd invest in an employee's growth, invest in your website's evolution.

## 4. The User Experience Conundrum: When Your Website Becomes a Maze

If your website requires special training to navigate, you've got a problem. Users should be able to find what they're looking for quickly and easily. But how do you know if your site is user-friendly?

A confusing or cluttered website can frustrate users and drive them away. If visitors can't find what they need within a few clicks, they're likely to leave and never return.

**Practical Tip:**

- Use Analytics Tools: Track user behavior with tools like Google Analytics. Look for high bounce rates or low time-on-page metrics.
- Conduct User Testing: Get feedback from people outside your organization.
- Regularly Use Your Own Website: Navigate it as if you were a customer. Can you easily find what you need?
- Simplify your design and layout to make it easy for users to find the information they need without frustration.

## 5. The Stagnation Situation: When Your Website Becomes a Time Capsule

In the fast-paced digital world of 2018, outdated content can make your site feel irrelevant. Your website should evolve with your business and your audience's needs.

Your website is like an employee that needs regular training and updates. If you don't keep it current, it can become a liability rather than an asset. Stale content can make your site feel abandoned and out of touch.

**Practical Tip:** Implement a content strategy. Regularly update your blog, refresh your product pages, and ensure all information is current. Consider adding dynamic elements like social media feeds or news tickers to keep your site feeling fresh. Engage your audience with new and relevant content that addresses their needs and interests.

## The Takeaway: Be Authentic and User-Focused

The key to avoiding a boring website isn't just about being different or following the latest trends. It's about being authentic to your brand and focusing on your users' needs.

Here's how to do that:

- **Know Your Audience:** Understand who your users are and what they're looking for when they come to your site.
- **Provide Value:** Every element on your site should serve a purpose and provide value to your users.
- **Be Authentic:** Let your brand's unique personality shine through in your design and content.
- **Stay Current:** Regularly update your site with fresh content and stay on top of web design trends.
- **Test and Iterate:** Continuously gather feedback and make improvements based on user behavior and preferences.

Remember, your website is often the first impression potential customers have of your business. Make it count by creating a site that's engaging, user-friendly, and true to your brand. By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to declaring your independence from boring websites in 2018 and beyond.
