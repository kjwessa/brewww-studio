ðŸ‘‹ Grab your favorite brew (coffee, beer, or heck, even a smoothie) because we've got some exciting news to share. November 9th marks a significant day here at Brewww Studio. Today, the "I" becomes a "We," and the "founder" becomes a "co-founder." That's right, Christine and I got married, and the company has grown in more ways than one.

## Why should you care?

Fair question! We wanted to share our joy with you because this isn't just work to usâ€”it's personal. Opposites attract, and the harmony of our differences is what makes Brewww work, and work for you. I'm the savory, and she's the sweet. Together, we bring something new to the table.

## Meet Kevin Wessa, the savory

My idea for Brewww began in 2012. I was in Minnesota at the time, helping to get a real estate company off the ground. As a co-owner and the VP of Operations, it was my direct responsibility to bring the founder's vision to life and make it accessible to the widest audience possible.

I knew nothing about building a website or a brand. I needed help. I found (and hired) a web designer and marketer to help me flesh out the vision of the company. Through those conversations, I was struck by one thing more than her technical abilities: she had way more fun in her profession than I ever did.

With a background in economics, finance, and management, I've always found the underpinnings of a company interesting. But more intriguing than a double helix of whiteboard statements, giving a company bones, flesh, and a personality always seemed more captivating.

Even in 2012, I was surprised at what happened next. As it became apparent the company I uprooted my life for wasn't sustainable, I didn't feel any sense of disappointment. My world was quickly changing and felt chaotic, but the seeds of calm had been planted. Years later, gathering skillsets and knowledge, 2018 was the year the seeds bore fruit, and I decided to formalize what had always seemed to exist.

## Enter Christine, the sweet

To the unobservant, Christine's background couldn't seem less relevant to the company we have today. With a degree in early childhood education, a vocal range rivaling Mariah Carey, and a ministry dedicated to bolstering the dignity of women...well...Christine is the kindness that softens the edges of the hard logic of code.

Her penchant for edifying the person amidst often harsh objectivity has made her an obvious choice as our Director of Strategy. When I'm stuck on a problem, staring blankly at the keyboard, her simple insights lead to the cutting-edge designs we savor here at Brewww.

Said another way, technical skills can be easily acquired, but it's the instinct (and eye) for cohesive design that leads to the best results.

## The Power of Creative Conflict

If I emphasize nothing else to you, let me impart these words: conflict is a good thing. It's natural to shy away from conflict. It's difficult. It's awkward. It's challenging. Yet, without it, I remain self-enclosed (and you'd suffer for it).

With every project, we challenge each other to go further in and farther up. For that reason, Christine is my partner in everything, Brewww included. Through her insights, her direction, and her gentle nudges, we've managed over and over to deliver results, create designs, and find solutions that leave our clients smiling.

We both believe whole-heartedly that mediocrity is boring, and we aim for greatness.

## Our Wedding Website: A Testament to Our Craft

Instead of going through "The Knot" or any other cookie-cutter website builder, we designed and built our wedding site from scratch. Some might say it was a waste of time on such a "disposable" item, only needed up until the wedding. But for us, kevinandchristine2019.com was a chance to show our commitment to craft, our care for our guests, and our desire to make something beautiful even before we were married.

## We are your better half

Brewww is larger than the two of us. Since our founding, we have assembled a team of incredible designers, developers, and creators around us. As a collective, we all pour ourselves into our craft to bring out the best that exists in you and help you live the greatness within.

We craft creative for the kind-hearted, the hustlers, and the visionaries. We are the Savory and the Sweet.

## What does this mean for you?

You might be wondering, "How does this dynamic duo affect my experience with Brewww?" Great question! Here's what you can expect:

1. A balanced perspective: With our diverse backgrounds and skill sets, we bring a well-rounded approach to every project.
2. Double the dedication: Two heads (and hearts) are better than one. We're fully invested in your success.
3. Continuous innovation: Our creative conflicts lead to breakthrough ideas that benefit you.
4. A personal touch: We're not just a faceless agency. We're a couple who cares deeply about your vision and success.

## The Takeaway: Brewing Up Something Special

As we embark on this new chapter, both personally and professionally, we're more excited than ever about the future of Brewww. Our union isn't just about usâ€”it's about strengthening our commitment to you, our clients and partners.

We believe that the best ideas are brewed over time, with care, passion, and a dash of creative tension. Just like a perfect cup of coffee or a well-crafted beer, we're here to help you create something that's both satisfying and memorable.

So, are you ready to join us on this wild ride? Let's grab a coffee (or a beer) and start brewing up something extraordinary together.
