Things aren't going our way. It's rare in a business environment that everything goes your way. It hasn't happened to me, but I suppose it could happen to someone (hence "rare," not "impossible"). Let me explain...

I made what I thought was a fatal error when I fell in love with my company name. I didn't research it extensively, at least, not at first. I was emotionally invested in the idea of Brewww, not realizing (yet) a Turkish software company had the same name and owned the coveted .com domain. Shoot.

As time went on, and I had the relevant (but humbler) .co domain, I made the real error...I let it get to me. I assumed that having the right domain would somehow define my business, establish legitimacy, or increase my traffic.

But here's what I'm realizing: this "behemoth" I've built up in my mind? It's not really a behemoth at all.

## The Mountain and the Molehill

We all have reasons not to build our business, reasons to make excuses. But often, it's the most minor of things we treat like a behemoth, a monster, something so much larger than ourselves that we give up, quickly or slowly (quietly quitting on our dream).

This domain issue? It's a molehill, not a mountain. And yet, I've been staring at it like it's Everest.

It's not uncommon for entrepreneurs to let small obstacles derail their dreams. In fact, according to a [2017 study by CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/), some of the top reasons startups fail include:

1. No market need (42%)
2. Ran out of cash (29%)
3. Not the right team (23%)
4. Got outcompeted (19%)
5. Pricing/Cost issues (18%)

Notice how "didn't have the perfect domain name" isn't on that list? That's because successful businesses focus on what truly matters.

## Pressing On Despite the Obstacles

Here's the truth: every business faces unexpected obstacles. It's not about avoiding them—it's about how we respond to them. Do we let them defeat us, or do we use them as stepping stones?

I'm choosing the latter. Because at the end of the day, it's not about the domain name. It's about what we do with it.

Interestingly, while many people dream of starting a business, far fewer actually take the plunge. A 2018 survey by Vistaprint found that 62% of Americans dream of starting their own business, but only about 10% actually do. The gap between intention and action is often filled with excuses and perceived obstacles that, in reality, aren't as insurmountable as they seem.

## Clients First, Always

In reality, I've never lost focus on my clients. Giving 110% and genuinely caring has gotten me to this point. I have put the needs of my clients before my own, and by doing that, steadily, my needs were met.

That said, although externally I was devoted to them, I was on occasion letting the little things get to me (the .co vs .com). Here is what I realized... I pride myself on finding where needs, stories, and technology overlap. Nowhere in that company vision does the "right" domain come into play.

## The Takeaway: Keep the Big Things Big, and the Small Things Small

As we celebrate our first birthday, I'm reminded of something a wise friend once told me: "Keep the big things big and the small things small."

Sure, we faced challenges. There were moments of doubt, late nights, and probably too much coffee. But we never lost sight of why we started Brewww in the first place: to help others bring their ideas to life.

Every business owner I've ever spoken with has something they wish was a little easier. As you begin your endeavor, do not forget about your clients, about your goals, or about the end game. The absolute worst thing anyone can do is quit the fight long before it begins.

You will always have some opponent in your business, but don't spin your wheels trying to fight an adversary that doesn't exist. We have had a steady stream of clients since day one, and still haven't launched our site, created our logo, or made business cards.

Perspective matters. Our success is not based on a domain name, but on the way we seek to understand and serve our clients. Period.

So here's to taking on the real behemoths—the ones that truly matter. The challenges of serving our clients better, of growing our skills, of making a real impact. Those are the mountains worth climbing.

Perfect domain name or not, we're here to stay. Bold, new, Brewww.
