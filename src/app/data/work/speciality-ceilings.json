      "content": "Specialty Ceilings LLC, based in Pensacola, FL, didn't have an online presence when they approached us. They needed an online home where they could feature case studies, show their team, and talk about their process. Although they already had a great reputation and track record, they felt they needed us to take their current logo, flesh out a visual and verbal identity, and create a fast website that showed potential clients exactly what they were capable of. Because it's something assumed the potential client is aware of (acoustical ceiling installation), their competitors didn't seem to put much effort into their websites. Specialty Ceilings wanted to take a step ahead of their competitors and focus on every detail to ensure their relevance against more established players in the space."
