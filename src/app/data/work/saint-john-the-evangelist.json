      "content": "Saint John the Evangelist is a Catholic Church in Panama City with a rich tradition. The pastor, Fr. Thomas Kennell, approached us to consider a website rebuild. Initially, the project focus was just to bring them up to date and move past their static and out-of-date Squarespace website. However, through our discovery process, more was desired. Often in the Catholic Church, people in the pews 'graduate' from their faith after confirmation, thinking there is little left to learn, and engagement drops. The pastor envisioned the parish (and its website) as a school of prayer, where education on the faith could exist in every element of parish life, continually educating the parish on 'why' everything is done. Another challenge was they had pretty much no content or photography on their site. Everything would need to be generated."

      "content": "If someone wants to learn more about their Catholic faith, they rarely go to their parish website, which exists primarily to serve the bulletin and inform about events. But why isn't their parish the best starting point for them to not only be aware of events but also learn about their faith? This gap presented a significant opportunity."

This involved creating engaging content, generating new photography, and ensuring the site was a resource for both information and education."
